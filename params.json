In short, a party.\r\n\r\nOf course, we’re talking about any kind of party; holiday parties, barbeque parties, football parties, even kids’ birthday parties. At any one of these events, you’ll find at least one or two opened beers, or potentially a mixed drink well on its way to being consumed before the piñata full of candy gets its first swing from little Johnny’s baseball bat.\r\n\r\nDinner, sometimes breakfast (or brunch), off-and-on at lunch, it’s there.\r\n\r\nHappy hour, and if work that day was a bitch, not-so-happy hour, you can find booze there as well.\r\n\r\nMonday Night Football fades from beers and shots to Taco Tuesday with its margaritas. Hump Day (Wednesday) follows with a good few Hywel’s Big Log beers. Thursday is the new Friday, and deserves some near-debauchers who care to prime themselves for…\r\n\r\n…The weekend, with almost three-day’s worth of pounding.\r\n\r\n### THE ALCOHOLIC WORLD: CAN IT BE ESCAPED?\r\n\r\nAs with any holiday season, say November, through December to January, drinking is a highly respected addition to the festivities.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to stop the alcoholic world just before it invades your world. The issue with this, however, is in doing so, you might end up ostracizing your group of old mates from yourself and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, if you do feel that the alcoholic world is an environment you can no longer keep up with, or find it difficult to understand, let alone wake up the next morning from, it might be a good idea to actually separate yourself from this group – at least for the worth of your own health.\r\n\r\n### WHAT IF I CAN’T SEPARATE MYSELF FROM THE ALCOHOLIC WORLD?\r\n\r\nIf you’re having difficulty pulling yourself away from your relations in the alcoholic world – that, in fact, you’d love to get away from them and the booze, but find you can’t, you might be dealing with more than separation anxiety. You might now have a substance abuse problem due to alcohol.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, seek out high-quality drug treatment from an accredited rehabilitation center that offers both in and outpatient services. This can only be the safest and most efficient manner for you to get past to what has become a serious alcohol dependency.\r\n\r\nContinue to fight, and don’t let the alcoholic world get the ultimate best of you. The ultimate best, that should be reserved for when you obtain sobriety.",
